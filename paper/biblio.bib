    Abstract = {Although the Averageness Hypothesis of facial attractiveness proposes that the attractiveness of faces is mostly a consequence of their averageness, one study has shown that caricaturing highly attractive faces makes them mathematically less average but more attractive. Here we systematically test the Averageness Hypothesis in five experiments using both rating and visual adaptation paradigms. Visual adaptation has previously been shown to increase both preferences for previously viewed face types (i.e. attractiveness) and their perceived normality (i.e. averageness). We used a visual adaptation procedure to test whether facial attractiveness is dependent upon faces' proximity to average (Averageness Hypothesis) or their location relative to average along an attractiveness dimension in face space (Contrast Hypothesis). While the typical pattern of change due to visual adaptation was found for judgments of normality, judgments of attractiveness resulted in a very different pattern. The results of our five experiments conclusively support the proposal that there are specific non-average characteristics that are particularly attractive. We discuss important implications for the interpretation of studies using a visual adaptation paradigm to investigate attractiveness.}

  abstract = {In psychological experiments involving facial stimuli, it is of great importance that the basic perceptual or psychological characteristics that are investigated are not confounded by factors such as brightness and contrast, head size, hair cut and color, skin color, and the presence of glasses and earrings. Standardization of facial stimulus materials reduces the effect of these confounding factors. We therefore employed a set of basic image processing techniques to deal with this issue. The processed images depict the faces in gray-scale, all at the same size, brightness, and contrast, and confined to an oval mask revealing only the basic features such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. The standardization was successfully applied to four different face databases, consisting of male and female faces and including neutral as well as happy facial expressions. An important advantage of the proposed standardization is that featural as well as configurational information is retained. We also consider the procedure to be a major contribution to the development of a de facto standard for the use of facial stimuli in psychological experiments. Such methodological standardization would allow a better comparison of the results of these studies.},

    Abstract = {Two lines of reasoning predict that highly social species will have mechanisms to influence behavior towards individuals depending on their degree of relatedness. First, inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton 1964) leads to the prediction that organisms will preferentially help closely-related kin over more distantly-related individuals. Second, evaluation of the relative costs and potential benefits of inbreeding suggests that the degree of kinship should also be considered when choosing a mate. In order to behaviorally discriminate between individuals with different levels of relatedness, organisms must be able to discriminate cues of kinship. Facial resemblance is one such potential cue in humans. Computer-graphic manipulation of face images has made it possible to experimentally test hypotheses about human kin recognition by facial phenotype matching. We review recent experimental evidence that humans respond to facial resemblance in ways consistent with inclusive fitness theory and considerations of the costs of inbreeding, namely by increasing prosocial behavior and positive attributions toward self-resembling images and selectively tempering attributions of attractiveness to other-sex faces in the context of a sexual relationship.}

    Abstract = {Contextual cues of genetic relatedness to familiar individuals, such as co-socialization and maternal-perinatal association, modulate prosocial and inbreeding avoidance behaviors towards specific potential siblings. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that contextual cues of kinship indirectly influence social behavior by affecting the perceived probability of genetic relatedness to familiar individuals. Here we test a more general alternative model, in which contextual cues of kinship can influence the kin recognition system more directly, changing how the mechanisms that regulate social behavior respond to cues of kinship, even in unfamiliar individuals for whom contextual cues of kinship are absent. We show that possessing opposite-sex siblings influences inbreeding-relevant perceptions of facial resemblance, but not prosocial perceptions. Women with brothers were less attracted to self-resembling, unfamiliar male faces than were women without brothers, while both groups found self-resemblance to be equally trustworthy for the same faces. Further analyses suggest this effect is driven by younger, rather than older, brothers, consistent with the proposal that only younger siblings exhibit the strong kinship cue of maternal-perinatal association. Our findings provide evidence that experience with opposite-sex siblings can directly influence inbreeding avoidance mechanisms and demonstrate a striking functional dissociation between the mechanisms that regulate inbreeding and the mechanisms that regulate prosocial behavior towards kin.}

The research relating to these issues highlights flexible, sophisticated systems that support and promote adaptive responses to faces that appear to function to maximize the benefits of both our mate choices and more general decisions about other types of social partners.}
