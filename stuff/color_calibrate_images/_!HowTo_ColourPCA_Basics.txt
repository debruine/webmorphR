HOW TO DERIVE COLOUR PCs


STEP 1
All images need to be warped to the same shape: each pixel needs to have a corresponding pixel in all images

This requires work in Webmorph. You can either use R to generate the  batch files you'll need for that (thanks to Ant), or manually (not that much fuss)

- Create average of your image set
	Download average template file from Webmorph and edit in Excel (see 1_batchAverage)
	
- Warp individual images to average image
	Download transfrom template file from Webmorph and edit in Excel (see 2_batchWarp)
	
- Save average as well as warped individual images in your working directory

- Create *transparent* mask using Webmorph, and save it in the same working directory. 

STEP 2
Extract colour values for each pixel of each image, run PCA, extract PCs using broken stick criterion and save colour PCs for subsequent analysis.
Ant has written a script for this.
