    <title>Overview of the org.apache.commons.fileupload.portlet component</title>

  <body>
    <p>
      An implementation of
      {@link org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUpload FileUpload}
      for use in portlets conforming to JSR 168. This implementation requires
      only access to the portlet's current <code>ActionRequest</code> instance,
      and a suitable
      {@link org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileItemFactory FileItemFactory}
      implementation, such as
      {@link org.apache.commons.fileupload.disk.DiskFileItemFactory DiskFileItemFactory}.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following code fragment demonstrates typical usage.
    </p>
<pre>
        DiskFileItemFactory factory = new DiskFileItemFactory();
        // Configure the factory here, if desired.
        PortletFileUpload upload = new PortletFileUpload(factory);
        // Configure the uploader here, if desired.
        List fileItems = upload.parseRequest(request);
</pre>
    <p>
